## Overview
This week, I have been focused on achieving sim2sim for the g1 robot and have obtained some preliminary results. Currently, I am attempting sim2real transfer but have noticed a significant gap between the simulation and real-world environments.


## Detailed Work Content

Sim2sim Achievement: I successfully established sim2sim for the g1 robot. This involved ensuring that the robot could perform tasks and behaviors within the simulation environment consistently and effectively. I conducted numerous experiments and fine-tuned various parameters to optimize the robot's performance in the simulated setting.
Initial Sim2real Attempts: I began the process of transferring the trained model from the simulation to the real-world robot. However, during these initial attempts, I observed a considerable gap in performance. The robot's behavior in the real world did not match the expected results from the simulation. I conducted preliminary analyses to identify potential causes of this gap, such as differences in physical dynamics, sensor data discrepancies, and environmental factors.

## Next Steps

Next week, I will delve deeper into analyzing the sim2real gap. I will systematically investigate the differences between the simulation and real-world environments. This will involve comparing the physical models, sensor data characteristics, and environmental conditions of both settings. I will then work on developing strategies to mitigate these differences, such as refining the simulation model to better approximate real-world physics, improving sensor data calibration and processing, and implementing domain adaptation techniques to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. Additionally, I will continue testing and iterating on the sim2real transfer process to gradually reduce the performance gap and improve the robot's real-world capabilities.

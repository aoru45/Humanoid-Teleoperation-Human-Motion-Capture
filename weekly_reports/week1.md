## Overview

This week, I have been primarily engaged in using the human2humanoid code as a baseline to train a reinforcement learning framework.
Significant progress has been achieved in training and simulation testing under Isaac Gym.

## Detailed Work Content

Utilization of human2humanoid Code: I leveraged the human2humanoid code as the foundational baseline.
This code provided essential initial structures and algorithms, which became the starting point for my reinforcement learning framework.
Training Process in Isaac Gym: I immersed myself in the training process within Isaac Gym. 
I carefully configured the learning parameters and ensured the proper functioning of the training environment. 
Through multiple iterations of training, the model gradually learned and improved its performance.
Simulation Testing: After the training phase, I conducted extensive simulation tests. 
I created various scenarios and tasks to evaluate the model's performance. 
The simulation results demonstrated that the model could achieve promising outcomes in different situations.

## Next Steps

Next week, I plan to further refine the model. 
This will involve analyzing the simulation results to identify any potential shortcomings or areas for improvement. 
I will make necessary adjustments to the model's architecture and parameters to enhance its performance and stability.
I will also explore new reinforcement learning algorithms or techniques that may be integrated into the framework to boost its learning efficiency and effectiveness. 
Additionally, I will document the progress made during the training and simulation processes to ensure a comprehensive record of the project's development.

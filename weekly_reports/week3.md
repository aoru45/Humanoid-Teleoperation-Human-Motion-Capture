## Overview
This week, I have been fully engaged in the sim2real transfer for the g1 robot and have achieved significant progress. I have also introduced several algorithmic innovations that have greatly enhanced the overall performance and efficiency of the reinforcement learning framework.
## Detailed Work Content
### Sim2real Implementation
I successfully completed the sim2real transfer for the g1 robot. This involved fine-tuning the model to adapt to the real-world environment and ensuring that the robot's behavior in the real world aligns with the expected results from the simulation. I conducted extensive testing and validation to verify the effectiveness of the transferred model. I systematically analyzed the differences between the simulation and real-world environments and made necessary adjustments to the model's parameters and architecture. This process required careful calibration and iterative testing to minimize the performance gap and achieve a smooth transition from simulation to reality.
### Algorithmic Improvements and Experiments
- Temporal Consistency
I explicitly added action smoothness constraints to the loss function by minimizing the first-order difference (velocity) and second-order difference (acceleration) of actions. This effectively addressed the issue of action jitter and improved the naturalness of the robot's movements. By incorporating these temporal consistency constraints, the robot's actions became more fluid and realistic, closely mimicking human-like motion patterns. The experimental results demonstrated a noticeable reduction in jerky movements and an overall enhancement in the visual and kinesthetic quality of the robot's performance.
- Hierarchical Policy
I implemented a hierarchical policy architecture consisting of a high-level policy for recognizing motion segments (such as walking cycles and jump preparations) and a low-level policy for executing specific joint controls. I also introduced automatic motion segment detection. This innovative approach allowed the robot to better understand and respond to different phases of motion, leading to more accurate and efficient decision-making. The high-level policy effectively identified the appropriate motion segments based on the current state and context, while the low-level policy precisely controlled the joint movements to achieve the desired actions. Experiments showed that this hierarchical structure reduced decision errors, significantly improving the robot's overall performance and reliability in various tasks.
- Motion Complexity Curriculum
I adopted a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases the difficulty during training. The training process was divided into four distinct phases:
- Phase 1: Static posture imitation. In this phase, the robot learned to maintain and transition between various static poses, building a foundational understanding of body control and balance.
- Phase 2: Simple straight walking. The robot then progressed to walking in straight lines, focusing on developing stable and rhythmic locomotion patterns.
- Phase 3: Complex turning and terrain navigation. At this stage, the robot was trained to perform more complex movements, such as turning and navigating uneven terrain, which required advanced balance and adaptation skills.
- Phase 4: Full dynamic dance movements. Finally, the robot tackled full dynamic dance routines, which demanded a high level of coordination, flexibility, and responsiveness.
This curriculum learning strategy proved to be highly effective, as it allowed the robot to gradually build upon previously acquired skills and knowledge. The progressive increase in difficulty enabled the robot to learn more efficiently and effectively. The robot demonstrated better generalization capabilities and was able to perform a wider range of movements with greater precision and confidence.
### Validation and Testing
I conducted comprehensive validation and testing of the sim2real model and the algorithmic innovations. I designed and executed a series of experiments to evaluate the robot's performance in various scenarios and tasks. The results consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with the robot exhibiting improved motion quality, reduced decision errors, and enhanced adaptability in real-world environments. I also collected and analyzed extensive data to quantify the performance improvements and to identify any potential areas for further refinement.

## Conclusion

This week's work has been highly productive and rewarding. The successful sim2real transfer and the implementation of the algorithmic innovations have significantly advanced the capabilities of the g1 robot. The temporal consistency constraints, hierarchical policy architecture, and motion complexity curriculum have collectively contributed to a more natural, efficient, and reliable robot performance. These achievements mark a crucial milestone in the project and provide a solid foundation for future developments and applications.

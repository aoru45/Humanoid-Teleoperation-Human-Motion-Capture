# Humanoid-Teleoperation-Human-Motion-Capture
The project is the final project of SI252 for the reinforcement learning course plans to use reinforcement learning to remotely operate humanoid robots based on real-time motion capture. I will use existing real-time motion capture algorithms to capture human movements, retarget the robots, and train them in a simulated environment and reinforcement learning to perform actions similar to those of humans.

# Plans
- [X] Proposal & Mocap method
- [X] Train baseline RL method human2humanoid
- [ ] Improve the baseline method
- [ ] Sim2sim simulation
- [ ] Sim2Real deployment
